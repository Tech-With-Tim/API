## üèÅ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Running with Docker](#-running-with-docker) if you want to setup the API faster with Docker.

### Discord application

Create a new Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by clicking the `New application` button and name it whatever you want.

![New application](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/794646477505822730/unknown.png)

Now that you have an application, go to the OAuth2 tab.

![OAuth2 tab](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/794648158272487435/unknown.png)

And add `http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/discord/callback` to the redirects.

![Redirects](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/798276213776318494/unknown.png)

### Prerequisites

Install Pipenv:

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

Install the required packages and the packages for development with Pipenv:

```sh
pipenv install --dev
```

### Environment variables

Set the environment variables. Start by writing this in a file named `local.env`:

```prolog
SECRET_KEY=some_random_characters_here
DB_URI=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/twt
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

And fill in the variables with the values below:

- ``SECRET_KEY`` is the key used for the JWT token encoding.
- ``DB_URI`` is the PostgreSQL database URI.
- ``DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`` is the Discord application ID. Copy it from your Discord application page (see below).
- ``DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`` is the Discord application secret. Copy it from your Discord application page (see below).

![Client ID and secret](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721750194797936823/794646777840140298/unknown.png)

### Running

Run the API and initialise the database:

```sh
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API should run at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). For more information about the CLI, check the docs [here](/docs/cli.md).

## üê≥ Running with Docker

Both the API and the [frontend](https://github.com/Tech-With-Tim/Frontend) can be started using Docker. Using Docker is generally recommended (but not strictly required) because it abstracts away some additional set up work.

- Setup the discord app like done [here](#discord-application).

- Make a file named `.env` like done [here](#environment-variables). You don't need the DB_URI environment variable though.

- Then make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed, if not read [this for docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [this for docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- Deploy the API:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

## ‚úÖ Linting

We use a pre-commit hook for linting the code before each commit. Set up the pre-commit hook:

```sh
pipenv run pre-commit install
```

If you want to run the pre-commit checks before trying to commit, you can do it with:

```sh
pipenv run lint
```

## üö® Tests

To test the API, we use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework to make sure that the code we write works.

Run the tests:

```sh
pipenv run pytest
```

**When you contribute, you need to add tests on the features you add.** An example can be seen in [tests/test_index.py](/tests/test_index.py).
